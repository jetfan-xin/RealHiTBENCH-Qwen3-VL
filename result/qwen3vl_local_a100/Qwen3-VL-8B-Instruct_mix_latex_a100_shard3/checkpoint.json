      "Prediction": "The table presents a risk assessment matrix for probability of failure based on criticality ratings across various factors including Fatigue Loading, Corrosion, Coating Defect, In-Service Defect, In-Service Loading, and Last Inspection. Each factor is assigned a weightage factor, and criticality ratings range from Severe to Negligible. Notable patterns show that higher criticality ratings (Severe) correspond to higher numerical values (10) across all factors, while lower criticality ratings (Negligible) correspond to lower values (1). The values decrease progressively from Severe to Negligible, indicating a direct relationship between the severity of the criticality rating and the assigned risk score. Additionally, the weightage factors for each factor suggest their relative importance in the overall risk assessment, with In-Service Defect having the highest weightage (0.25) and In-Service Loading and Last Inspection having the lowest (0.10).",
