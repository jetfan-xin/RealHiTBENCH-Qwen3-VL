Main columns include Criticality (Fatigue Loading, Corrosion, Coating Defect, In-Service Defect, In-Service Loading, Last Inspection), Weightage Factor, and Criticality Rating (Severe, High, Moderate, Low, Negligible). Notable patterns: higher criticality ratings (Severe) consistently assign higher PoF values (e.g., 10 for Severe), while lower ratings (Negligible) assign lower values (e.g., 1). Weightage factors vary by criticality type (e.g., 0.20 for Fatigue Loading and Corrosion, 0.15 for Coating Defect). PoF thresholds and defect severity levels correlate directly with criticality ratings, with more severe defects or longer lifespans corresponding to higher criticality ratings.",

TNF presence significantly elevates MFI fold changes in most treatments, especially in 'DC + SHP1 siRNA + TNF' (mean 9.10, SD 0.598) and 'DC- siRNA + TNF' (mean 8.04, SD 0.637). In contrast, 'DC + SHP1 siRNA - TNF' shows minimal fold change (mean 0.76, SD 0.979), indicating TNF is crucial for MFI induction.
