It includes columns for the country, item, budgeted sales, actual sales, and the variance between actual and budgeted sales. Notable insights include the USA and UK showing significant differences between actual and budgeted sales for some items, with the USA generally having a mix of both positive and negative variances, while the UK shows a more consistent pattern of actual sales exceeding budgeted sales.
