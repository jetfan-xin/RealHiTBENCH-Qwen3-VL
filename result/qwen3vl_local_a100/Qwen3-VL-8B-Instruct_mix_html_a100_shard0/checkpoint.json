      "Reference": "The table provides employment data for the civilian noninstitutional population from 1953 onward. Main columns include 'Year,' 'Civilian Population,' 'Labor Force,' 'Employed (Total, Agriculture, Nonagricultural Industries),' 'Unemployed (Number, Percent),' and 'Not in Labor Force.' Insights show trends in employment rates, shifts between agricultural and nonagricultural sectors, and unemployment percentages over time.",
      "Prediction": "This table presents annual averages of employment status for the civilian noninstitutional population in the U.S. from 1953 to 2023. Key columns include: \"Year\" (time period), \"Civilian noninstitutional population\" (total population aged 16+), \"Civilian labor force total\" (total labor force), \"Percent of population\" (labor force as % of total population), \"Employed\" (total employed and their % of population), \"Agri-culture\" (agricultural employment), \"Nonagricultural industries\" (non-agricultural employment), \"Unemployed\" (number unemployed and % of labor force), and \"Not in labor force\" (population not in labor force). Trends show a steady increase in the civilian population and labor force over time. The labor force participation rate (percent of population) generally increased from ~58.9% in 1953 to ~62.6% in 2023. The unemployment rate (% of labor force) has fluctuated, peaking around 9.7% in 1982 and 2009, and generally declining since the early 2000s. The number of unemployed people has also increased over time, though the unemployment rate has decreased, indicating a larger labor force with relatively fewer unemployed individuals as a percentage.",
