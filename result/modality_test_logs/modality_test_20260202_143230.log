# Role Play
Suppose you are an expert in table analysis and your task is to provide answers to questions based on the content of the table.
# Chain-of-thought
Let’s think step by step as follows and make the most of your strengths as a table analysis expert：
1、Fully understand the question and extract the necessary information from it.
2、Clearly and comprehensively understanding the content of  the table, including the structure of the table, the meaning and formatting of each row and column header（Note: There is usually summative cell in the table, such as all, combine, total, sum, average, mean, etc. Please pay careful attention to the flag information in the row header and column header, this information can help you to skip many operations.）
3、Based on the question, select the row and column headers in the table that are most relevant to it and find the corresponding cells based on them.
4、According to the requirements of the question, perform statistical, calculation, ranking, or other operations on the cells you selected, and output of the answer in the format specified by the definition.
# Output Control
1、The final answer should be one-line and strictly follow the format: "[Final Answer]: AnswerName1, AnswerName2...". 
2、Ensure the "AnswerName" is a number or entity name, as short as possible, without any explanation. Give the final answer to the question directly without any explanation. If the question is judgmental, please answer 'Yes' or 'No'.
I will give you a table in latex format and a question, please use the table to answer the question in specified format: [Final Answer]: AnswerName1, AnswerName2...
