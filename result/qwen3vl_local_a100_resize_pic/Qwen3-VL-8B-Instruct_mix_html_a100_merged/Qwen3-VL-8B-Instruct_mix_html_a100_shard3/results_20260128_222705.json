Notably, some countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan show substantial declines in the early periods followed by increases or stabilization. In contrast, regions like Northern Europe (e.g., Denmark, Finland) exhibit more consistent declines or modest increases. The data also reveals significant regional disparities, with some countries experiencing large negative APC values (e.g., -24.8 in Greece) and others showing positive APC values (e.g., 20.6 in Greece).
