The 'TOTAL luminal' and 'TOTAL basal' columns summarize the overall counts for each type at each time point. Notable trends include a general decrease in the total number of luminal clones over time, while basal clones show a more variable pattern.

The table also provides total luminal and total basal counts for each time point.

Some mice show more significant declines than others, and mouse 6 only appears at the 225-day time point.

      "Reference": "The table details cropland distribution across U.S. regions, including categories like “Cropland used for crops,” “Idle cropland,” and “Cropland pasture.” Notable trends include the Northern Plains leading in cropland totals, the Corn Belt excelling in cropland used for crops, and the Southern Plains having the highest cropland pasture, highlighting regional agricultural diversity.",
      "Prediction": "The table presents a detailed breakdown of cropland distribution across U.S. regions and states, categorized into cropland used for crops, idle cropland, and cropland pasture. The U.S. total cropland amounts to 390,236 thousand acres, with 338,093 thousand acres used for crops, 38,695 thousand acres idle, and 13,436 thousand acres in pasture. Notable regional variations include the Corn Belt (89,269 thousand acres total), Northern Plains (98,588 thousand acres total), and Mountain (39,319 thousand acres total) as major cropland holders. The Northeast and Appalachian regions show relatively smaller totals, while states like California, Texas, and Iowa exhibit high cropland usage. Idle cropland is most prevalent in the Northern Plains and Mountain regions, while cropland pasture is most significant in the Southern Plains and Mountain regions. The District of Columbia and Hawaii have negligible cropland, with Hawaii having no idle cropland. The data reflects regional agricultural specialization and land use patterns.",

      "Reference": "The table outlines the distribution of assistance groups based on group size, including the total number of groups and their percentages, as well as urban and rural breakdowns with corresponding percentages. Significant trends include rural assistance groups generally having a higher percentage compared to urban groups, particularly for smaller group sizes like 1、2 and 3. Urban percentages are higher in mid-sized groups, while both decline for larger group sizes (6 and above).",
      "Prediction": "The table summarizes the distribution of persons across different assistance group sizes (1 to 12) for total, urban, and rural populations, showing the number of groups and their percentages. Key observations include: Assistance groups of size 2 are the most common (35.07% of total), followed by size 1 (22.89%). Urban areas have a higher proportion of larger groups (e.g., size 2 groups account for 34.51% of urban groups), while rural areas have a higher proportion of smaller groups (e.g., size 1 groups account for 30.47% of rural groups). The average group size is 2.6 for total, 2.8 for urban, and 2.3 for rural. Additionally, 81.4% of all assistance groups receive the maximum grant.",
