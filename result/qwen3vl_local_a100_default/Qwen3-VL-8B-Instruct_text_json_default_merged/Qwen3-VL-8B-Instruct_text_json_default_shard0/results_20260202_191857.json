Main columns include 'Year,' 'Civilian Population,' 'Labor Force,' 'Employed (Total, Agriculture, Nonagricultural Industries),' 'Unemployed (Number, Percent),' and 'Not in Labor Force.' Insights show trends in employment rates, shifts between agricultural and nonagricultural sectors, and unemployment percentages over time.",

Key columns include: \"Civilian noninstitutional population\" (total population 16+), \"Civilian labor force\" (employed + unemployed), \"Employed\", \"Unemployed\", \"Not in labor force\", and breakdowns by \"Agriculture\" and \"Nonagricultural industries\". Trends show steady growth in total population and labor force, rising employment rates, and a gradual decline in unemployment percentage after 1982. The proportion of the population in the labor force increased over time, peaking around 2000, followed by minor fluctuations. The unemployment rate peaked in 2020 at 8.1%, then declined. Employment in agriculture has consistently declined, while nonagricultural employment dominates.",
